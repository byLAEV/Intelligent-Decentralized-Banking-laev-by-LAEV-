# Intelligent-Decentralized-Banking-laev-by-LAEV-
Decentralized and intelligent banking system that replaces inflationary tokenization with programmable, traceable, and configurable native coins from the moment of extraction. It integrates autonomous AI, algorithmic inheritance, and an interoperable banking layer across fiat, stablecoins, and cryptocurrencies.


ðŸ§ ðŸ’° Intelligent Decentralized Banking

ðŸ“œ Abstract

This proposal addresses and resolves key structural failures in current blockchain-based monetary systems, traditional finance, and artificial intelligence integrations.

The core innovation lies in the extraction of native blockchain coins using a multi-format proof-of-work system, capable of producing coins that are fully traceable, trackable, and configurable from the moment of extraction. Each coin retains metadata of its origin block, intended use, and flow through the ecosystem. This eradicates the current opaque and inflationary tokenization model, replacing it with native-layer programmable coins. Tokenization, as we know it, becomes obsolete.

The system also introduces a fully integrated AI framework: independent AI models under the name Hanbot Asiste, designed to act as programmable chatbot agents. These agents function as intelligent support units across legal, financial, and user-experience layers.

Additionally, the platform merges traditional banking infrastructure with decentralized finance in a single electronic monetary system, capable of interoperating with fiat, stablecoins, and crypto-native value units seamlessly.

Finally, a new algorithmic inheritance protocol is implemented â€” one designed to operate in perpetuity. This means a person's digital wealth and smart contract permissions can be logically transferred, continuously verified, and executed across generations without reliance on centralized legal frameworks.

The result: an intelligent, stable, and just monetary ecosystem.
